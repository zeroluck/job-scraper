# Job Scraper & Application Assistant

This project is a comprehensive suite of tools designed to automate and enhance the job searching process, primarily focusing on LinkedIn. It scrapes job postings, parses resumes, scores job suitability against a candidate's resume, manages job application statuses, and can even generate custom PDF resumes. The system leverages AI (Google Gemini) for advanced text processing and Supabase for data storage.

## Features

- **Job Scraping**: Automatically scrapes job postings. ([scraper.py](scraper.py))
- **Resume Parsing**:
  - Extracts text from PDF resumes using `pdfplumber`. ([resume_parser.py](resume_parser.py))
  - Utilizes Google Gemini AI to parse resume text into structured data ([parse_resume_with_ai.py](parse_resume_with_ai.py))
- **Job Scoring**: Scores job descriptions against a parsed resume using AI to determine suitability. ([score_jobs.py](score_jobs.py))
- **Job Management**:
  - Tracks the status of job applications.
  - Marks old or inactive jobs as expired.
  - Periodically checks if active jobs are still available.
    ([job_manager.py](job_manager.py))
- **Data Storage**: Uses Supabase to store job data, resume details, and application statuses. (Utility functions in [supabase_utils.py](supabase_utils.py))
- **Custom PDF Resume Generation**: Generates ATS-friendly PDF resumes using RenderCV (YAML → Typst → PDF). ([rendercv_generator.py](rendercv_generator.py))
- **AI-Powered Text Processing**: Leverages Google Gemini for tasks like resume parsing and converting job descriptions to Markdown.
- **Automated Workflows**: Includes GitHub Actions for running tasks like job scraping, scoring, and management on a schedule. ([workflows](.github/workflows/))

## Setup and Installation

This project is designed to run primarily through GitHub Actions. Follow these steps to set it up for your own use:

1.  **Fork the Repository:**
    *   Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page to create a copy of this repository in your own GitHub account.

2.  **Create a Supabase Project:**
    *   Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
    *   Once your project is created, navigate to the "SQL Editor" section.
    *   Open the `supabase_setup/init.sql` file from this repository, copy its content, and run it in your Supabase SQL Editor. This will set up the necessary tables (`jobs` and `resumes`).

3.  **Obtain Google Gemini API Keys:**
    *   Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) (or the relevant Google Cloud project console where Gemini API is enabled).
    *   Create two API keys. These will be used by the application to interact with the Gemini models for tasks like resume parsing and job scoring.

4.  **Configure GitHub Repository Secrets:**
    *   In your forked GitHub repository, go to "Settings".
    *   In the left sidebar, navigate to "Secrets and variables" under the "Security" section, and then click on "Actions".
    *   Click on "New repository secret" and add the following secrets:
        *   `GEMINI_FIRST_API_KEY`: Your primary Google Gemini API key.
        *   `GEMINI_SECOND_API_KEY`: Your secondary Google Gemini API key.
        *   `LINKEDIN_EMAIL`: The email address associated with your resume (used for certain scraping tasks if configured, and as an identifier).
        *   `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Your Supabase project's `service_role` key (found in your Supabase project settings under API > Project API keys).
        *   `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project's URL (found in your Supabase project settings under API > Configuration > URL).

5.  **Upload Your Resume:**
    *   In your forked GitHub repository, upload your resume to the root directory. **The resume file must be named `resume.pdf`**.

6.  **Parse Your Resume:**
    *   Go to the "Actions" tab in your forked GitHub repository.
    *   Find the workflow named "Parse Resume Manually" in the list of workflows.
    *   Click on it, and then click the "Run workflow" button. This will trigger the `resume_parser.py` script, which will extract information from your `resume.pdf`, parse it using AI, and store the structured data in your Supabase `resumes` table.

7.  **Configure Job Search Parameters (Edit `config.py`):**
    *   In your forked GitHub repository, navigate to the [config.py](config.py) file.
    *   Edit the file to customize your job search preferences. The main variables you'll likely want to change are:

        ```python
        # --- LinkedIn Search Configuration ---
        LINKEDIN_SEARCH_QUERIES = ["it support", "full stack web developer", "application support", "cybersecurity analyst", "AI"] # Keywords for LinkedIn job search
        LINKEDIN_LOCATION = "Singapore" # Target location for LinkedIn jobs
        LINKEDIN_GEO_ID = 102454443 # Geographical ID for LinkedIn location (e.g., Singapore)
        LINKEDIN_JOB_TYPE = "F" # Job type: "F" for Full-time, "C" for Contract, etc.
        LINKEDIN_JOB_POSTING_DATE = "r86400" # Time filter: "r86400" for past 24 hours, "r604800" for past week, leave it empty for 'anytime'

        # --- Careers Future Search Configuration ---
        CAREERS_FUTURE_SEARCH_QUERIES = ["IT Support", "Full Stack Web Developer", "Application Support", "Cybersecurity Analyst", "Artifical Intelligence"] # Keywords for CareersFuture job search
        CAREERS_FUTURE_SEARCH_CATEGORIES = ["Information Technology"] # Job categories for CareersFuture
        CAREERS_FUTURE_SEARCH_EMPLOYMENT_TYPES = ["Full Time"] # Employment types for CareersFuture
        ```
    *   **IMPORTANT**: Do not modify other variables in `config.py` as they are carefully calibrated to prevent rate limiting and potential account bans. Only edit the search queries and location parameters shown above.
    *   Commit the changes to your `config.py` file in your repository.

8.  **Enable GitHub Actions:**
    *   Go to the "Actions" tab in your forked GitHub repository.
    *   You will see a message saying "Workflows aren't running on this repository". Click the "Enable Actions on this repository" button (or a similar prompt) to allow the scheduled workflows to run automatically.
    *   Ensure all workflows listed (e.g., `scrape_jobs.yml`, `score_jobs.yml`, `job_manager.yml`) are enabled. If any are disabled, you may need to enable them individually.

## Automated Workflows

Once the setup is complete and GitHub Actions are enabled, the workflows defined in [workflows](.github/workflows/) are scheduled to run automatically:

*   **`scrape_jobs.yml`**: Periodically scrapes new job postings from LinkedIn and CareersFuture based on your `config.py` settings and saves them to your Supabase database.
*   **`score_jobs.yml`**: Periodically scores the newly scraped jobs and jobs with custom resumes against your parsed resume / custom resume and updates the scores in the database.
*   **`job_manager.yml`**: Periodically manages job statuses (e.g., marks old jobs as expired, checks if active jobs are still available).
*   **`hourly_resume_customization.yml`**: (If enabled and configured) May run tasks related to customizing resumes for specific jobs.

You can monitor the execution of these actions in the "Actions" tab of your repository.

## Usage

After the initial setup and the "Parse Resume Manually" action has successfully run, the system will operate automatically through the scheduled GitHub Actions.

You can interact with the data directly through your Supabase dashboard to view scraped jobs, your parsed resume, and job scores.

### Web Interface for Viewing Data

A Next.js web application is available to view and manage the scraped jobs, your resume details, and job scores from the database.

*   **Repository:** [jobs-scrapper-web](https://github.com/anandanair/jobs-scraper-web)
*   **Setup:** To use the web interface, clone the `jobs-scrapper-web` repository and follow the setup instructions provided in its `README.md` file to run it locally. This will typically involve configuring it to connect to your Supabase instance.

The individual Python scripts can still be run locally for development or testing, but this requires setting up a local Python environment, installing dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and creating a local `.env` file with the necessary credentials (mirroring the GitHub secrets).

**Local Development Setup (Optional):**

1.  **Clone your forked repository locally:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anandanair/linkedin-jobs-scrapper
    cd linkedin-jobs-scrapper
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # On Windows
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    ```
4.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    *   In the root of your local repository, create a `.env` file.
    *   Add the same keys and values that you configured as GitHub secrets:
        ```env
        GEMINI_FIRST_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_PRIMARY"
        GEMINI_SECOND_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_SECONDARY"
        LINKEDIN_EMAIL="YOUR_LINKEDIN_EMAIL"
        SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
        SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
        ```
5.  **Run scripts locally (example):**
    ```bash
    python scraper.py
    python resume_parser.py 
    python score_jobs.py 
    python job_manager.py
    ```
