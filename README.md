# Job Scraper & Application Assistant

Turn a broad LinkedIn search into a structured, lane-aware job pipeline. The scraper discovers and canonicalizes listings, preserves repost history and query provenance, filters and scores each career lane independently, extracts market insights, and generates customized resumes without losing cross-lane matches.

## Features

- **Job Scraping**: Automatically scrapes job postings. ([scraper.py](scraper.py))
- **Configurable Career Lanes**: Search queries, Canada/USA/EEA coverage, filters, lookback, and scrape limits are managed in Supabase through the companion web app.
- **Cross-Lane Deduplication**: One canonical job can retain multiple independent lane memberships, query matches, filter results, scores, insights, and resumes.
- **Resume Parsing**:
  - Extracts text from PDF resumes using `pdfplumber`. ([resume_parser.py](resume_parser.py))
  - Utilizes Google Gemini AI to parse resume text into structured data ([parse_resume_with_ai.py](parse_resume_with_ai.py))
- **Job Scoring**: Scores job descriptions against a parsed resume using AI to determine suitability. ([score_jobs.py](score_jobs.py))
  Scheduled multi-lane scoring reads `scrape_settings.score_jobs` from the database before checking lane worker prerequisites and exits successfully with `skipped_score_jobs_disabled` when false. There is no workflow/environment bypass for that switch. The only supported bypass is the clearly named single-lane recovery API `score_jobs.run_manual_scoring_ignoring_score_jobs_setting("<canonical_lane>")`; it requires an explicit lane and must not be used by schedulers.
- **Job Market Insights**: Extracts recurring keywords from unanalyzed jobs into per-job facts in `job_keyword_insights` and aggregate totals in `keyword_insights` using `analyze_jobs.py` for downstream reporting and trend analysis. Hourly pipeline runs are incremental and process at most the environment-configurable `JOB_INSIGHTS_MAX_JOBS` (default `100`) per run, with aggregates split by archetype and provider; manual recovery supports backlog and one-time replacement passes. ([analyze_jobs.py](analyze_jobs.py))
- **Universal LLM Support**: Supports 400+ model providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Groq, etc.) via a unified abstraction layer. ([llm_client.py](llm_client.py))
- **Job Management**:
  - Tracks the status of job applications.
  - Marks old or inactive jobs as expired.
  - Periodically checks if active jobs are still available.
    ([job_manager.py](job_manager.py))
- **Data Storage**: Uses Supabase to store job data, resume details, and application statuses. (Utility functions in [supabase_utils.py](supabase_utils.py))
- **Canonical Listing History**: Preserves every source listing ID while distinguishing simultaneous variants, location variants, and confirmed later posting waves.
- **Custom PDF Resume Generation**: Generates ATS-friendly PDF resumes from structured resume data. ([pdf_generator.py](pdf_generator.py))
- **AI-Powered Text Processing**: Leverages any configured LLM for tasks like resume parsing and job description formatting.
- **Quota Management**: Built-in rate limiting, exponential backoff, and daily budget tracking for LLM API calls. Features task-specific Gemini fallback chains for job scoring and job insights extraction.
- **Automated Workflows**: Includes optimized GitHub Actions for running tasks on a schedule without exhausting quotas. ([workflows](.github/workflows/))

### LLM Routing Notes

- Job scoring uses a task-specific scoring chain via `job_scoring_client`.
- Job insights analysis uses a task-specific extraction chain via `job_insights_client`.
- Resume parsing and resume generation still use the generic `primary_client` and are not yet routed through dedicated task-specific chains.

## Getting Started

The production path is GitHub Actions + Supabase. Local execution uses the same database configuration by default.

1.  **Fork the Repository:**
    - Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page to create a copy of this repository in your own GitHub account.

2.  **Create and migrate a Supabase project:**
    - Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
    - Once your project is created, navigate to the "SQL Editor" section.
    - Run `supabase_setup/init.sql` first. It creates the base schema, storage buckets, and adaptive LinkedIn objects in base-install mode while deferring the externally owned job-membership relation.
    - Next, apply the migrations in the companion `job-scraper-web/supabase/migrations` directory. The configurable-lane migration adds `job_archetype_memberships`, the lane registry, search configuration, resume profiles, protected RPCs, and the explicit `software_tpm` → `technology_delivery` compatibility alias.
    - Do not start scraping until those companion migrations have completed. Existing installations must have the companion membership schema in place before applying standalone `supabase_setup/add_adaptive_linkedin_discovery.sql`; that migration intentionally fails fast when the contract is absent.
    - For an older schema, apply outstanding migrations in order rather than editing production tables manually.
    - Scheduled `Analyze Job Insights` runs only process new unanalyzed jobs. Use the manual `replacement_backfill` workflow input only when you explicitly want a one-time reanalysis of previously analyzed jobs.

3.  **Obtain API Keys for Your LLM Provider:**
    - Get API key(s) from your chosen provider (e.g., [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/), etc.).

4.  **Configure GitHub Repository Secrets and Variables:**
    - In your forked GitHub repository, go to "Settings".
    - In the left sidebar, navigate to "Secrets and variables" under the "Security" section, and then click on "Actions".
    - **Add Repository Secrets** (Click "New repository secret"):
      - `LLM_API_KEY`: Your primary LLM API key (e.g., for Gemini or Groq). Also accepts legacy `GEMINI_FIRST_API_KEY`.
      - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: (Optional) Your OpenAI API key if using GPT models.
      - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: (Optional) Your Anthropic API key if using Claude models.
      - `GROQ_API_KEY`: (Optional) Your Groq API key if using Groq models.
      - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Your Supabase project's `service_role` key.
      - `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project's URL.

    - > **Note:** Other non-sensitive variables like `LLM_MODEL`, `LLM_MAX_RPM`, and `JOBS_TO_SCORE_PER_RUN` are now hardcoded in `config.py` as safe defaults. You only need to set them as GitHub Variables if you want to override the `config.py` defaults (though this is no longer the recommended approach).

5.  **Configure career lanes in the web app:**
    - Start `job-scraper-web`, establish an administrator session, and open `/config`.
    - Review the six lanes: `technology_delivery`, `systems_platform_ops`, `network_infrastructure`, `datacenter_operations`, `ai_workflow_automation`, and `building_controls`.
    - Enable the desired precision and recall queries, choose Canada, USA, EEA, or any combination per lane, and set lookback and scrape limits.
    - Save the configuration. The next scraper run reads that revision through the service-role-only `get_scraper_configuration()` RPC.

6.  **Run the pipeline:**
    - Trigger `Scrape Jobs` manually or wait for its schedule.
    - Scoring, insights, and resume workers process every enabled lane when their archetype input is blank. Supply a canonical lane slug for a targeted recovery run.
    - Resume-dependent workers skip lanes without an enabled `archetype_resume_profiles` row; scraping remains enabled.

### Configuration source

Database configuration is authoritative by default:

```bash
SCRAPE_CONFIG_SOURCE=db python scraper.py
```

For development or recovery, supply a complete validated configuration document. Overrides replace rather than merge with database configuration:

```bash
SCRAPE_CONFIG_SOURCE=file SCRAPE_CONFIG_FILE=./scrape-config.json python scraper.py
SCRAPE_CONFIG_SOURCE=env SCRAPE_CONFIG_JSON='{"version":1,...}' python scraper.py
```

Keep `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in environment secrets. Never place it in a configuration document or browser-exposed variable.

7.  **Upload Your Resumes to Supabase Storage:**
    - In your Supabase project dashboard, navigate to **Storage** in the left sidebar.
    - Find the **`resumes`** bucket (created by the `init.sql` script in step 2).
    - Upload the global resume as `resume.pdf`.
    - For lane-aware scoring, upload one PDF per enabled lane as `archetypes/<canonical-lane>.pdf`.
    - > **⚠️ Security Note:** Your resume is stored securely in your private Supabase Storage bucket — it is **never committed to the public GitHub repository**. This protects your personal information (name, email, phone, address, etc.) from being publicly visible.

6.  **Parse Your Resume:**
    - Go to the "Actions" tab in your forked GitHub repository.
    - Find the workflow named "Parse Resume Manually" in the list of workflows.
    - First select `global` to parse `resume.pdf` into `base_resume`.
    - Then select `all` to parse every enabled lane PDF and atomically update `archetype_resume_profiles`. A single canonical lane can be selected for targeted recovery.

7.  **Configure Job Search Parameters (Edit `config.py`):**
    - In your forked GitHub repository, navigate to the [config.py](config.py) file.
    - Edit the file to customize your job search preferences. The main variables you'll likely want to change are:

      ```python
      # --- LinkedIn Search Configuration ---
      LINKEDIN_SEARCH_QUERIES = ["maths lecturer", "statistics lecturer"] # Your keywords
      LINKEDIN_LOCATION = "Singapore" # Target location
      LINKEDIN_GEO_ID = 102454443 # Geo ID (Singapore: 102454443, Dubai: 100205264)
      LINKEDIN_JOB_TYPE = "F" # "F" for Full-time
      LINKEDIN_JOB_POSTING_DATE = "r86400" # "r86400" for past 24 hours

      # --- Careers Future Search Configuration ---
      CAREERS_FUTURE_SEARCH_QUERIES = ["IT Support", "Full Stack Web Developer"]
      CAREERS_FUTURE_SEARCH_CATEGORIES = ["Information Technology"]

      # --- LLM configuration ---
      # For a full list of 100+ supported providers and model naming schemes, see:
      # https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers

      LLM_MODEL = "gemini"            # Model to use
      LLM_MAX_RPM = 10                # Max requests per minute
      LLM_REQUEST_DELAY_SECONDS = 8   # Delay between calls

      # --- Processing Limits ---
      JOBS_TO_SCORE_PER_RUN = 1       # Scaled for free tier
      MAX_JOBS_PER_SEARCH = {
          "linkedin": 2,
          "careers_future": 10,
      }
      ```

    - **IMPORTANT**: Do not modify other variables in `config.py` as they are carefully calibrated to prevent rate limiting and potential account bans. Only edit the search queries and location parameters shown above.
    - Commit the changes to your `config.py` file in your repository.

8.  **Enable GitHub Actions:**
    - Go to the "Actions" tab in your forked GitHub repository.
    - You will see a message saying "Workflows aren't running on this repository". Click the "Enable Actions on this repository" button (or a similar prompt) to allow the scheduled workflows to run automatically.
    - Ensure all workflows listed (e.g., `scrape_jobs.yml`, `score_jobs.yml`, `job_manager.yml`, `analyze_jobs.yml`) are enabled. If any are disabled, you may need to enable them individually.

## Automated Workflows

Once the setup is complete and GitHub Actions are enabled, the workflows defined in [workflows](.github/workflows/) are scheduled to run automatically:

- **`scrape_jobs.yml`**: At 00:05 and hourly from 09:05 through 21:05 America/New_York, serially orchestrates the single LinkedIn worker, exhaustive Freehire compatibility draining in batched pages, and source publication finalization. Search and detail requests share one configurable global cadence. Manual recovery may set one `SCRAPE_ARCHETYPE`, while scheduled runs leave it blank and scrape every enabled lane. Publication pruning is bounded maintenance outside the atomic generation switch.
- **`score_jobs.yml`**: Periodically scores the newly scraped jobs and jobs with custom resumes against your parsed resume / custom resume and updates the scores in the database.
- **`job_manager.yml`**: Periodically manages job statuses (e.g., marks old jobs as expired, checks if active jobs are still available).
- **`analyze_jobs.yml`**: Runs incremental job-insight analysis after each successful source pipeline without extending that pipeline's critical path. Manual backlog and replacement recovery use the same dedicated non-cancelling concurrency group.
  A manually dispatched full source recovery requires a separate manual analysis dispatch; this prevents a successful single-lane recovery from launching global analysis.
- **`freehire_compat.yml`**: Manual-only compatibility recovery with an isolated non-cancelling concurrency group. It fetches `500` rows per batched Supabase page by default and, when draining with `apply` enabled, continues until no eligible rows remain. Replacement runs require a stable `replacement_before` timestamp. Scheduled compatibility is owned exclusively by `scrape_jobs.yml`.
- **`backfill_same_id_relists.yml`**: Manual, dry-run-default same-ID repair. The default remains `500`; select `5000` to cover the full current dataset in one invocation.
- **`hourly_resume_customization.yml`**: (If enabled and configured) May run tasks related to customizing resumes for specific jobs.

You can monitor the execution of these actions in the "Actions" tab of your repository.

All publication-pipeline and manual recovery runs share the `linkedin-freehire-pipeline` concurrency group, so they never mutate compatibility/insight state concurrently. The publication gate queries production after all pipeline jobs succeed and reports `current`, `pending`, `failed`, and `published` counts. Pending and failed historical rows are informational and do not block already-current rows: `public.freehire_jobs` remains the per-row input to publication snapshots.

Set repository variable `JOB_INSIGHTS_MAX_JOBS` to tune the conservative hourly analysis cap; if unset, the workflow and `config.py` use `100`. The hourly job always keeps backlog draining and replacement analysis disabled, preserving incremental-only semantics.

### Pull-only downstream publication contract

The source does not notify or contact downstream. `public.freehire_publication_state` identifies the latest completed generation with `generation`, `published_at`, `source_scrape_watermark`, `row_count`, and `schema_version`. `public.freehire_publication_snapshots` stores the complete immutable `freehire_jobs` row as `payload`, plus `canonical_job_id` and `import_hash`, keyed by `(generation, canonical_job_id)`. Exactly the latest three completed generations are retained. A page RPC transaction is safe during concurrent prune, but a generation is not guaranteed across an indefinitely slow sequence of page requests; finish promptly and restart from current state if it becomes unavailable.

Downstream pull algorithm:

1. Using a service-role credential, call `get_freehire_publication_state()` and save its generation and expected row count. Prefer a narrowly scoped proxy or custom database role, when available, instead of broadly exposing the Supabase service-role credential.
2. Call `get_freehire_publication_page(generation, after_canonical_job_id, page_size)` repeatedly for that fixed generation. Start with a null cursor, use at most `1000`, and set the next cursor to the last returned `canonical_job_id`. Never switch generations during a pull.
3. Upsert each payload by `canonical_job_id`; use `import_hash` to skip unchanged rows. Track every canonical ID seen in this generation.
4. Only after all pages are received and the observed count equals state `row_count`, delete local rows absent from the completed generation.
5. Atomically commit the local changes and downstream generation cursor at the end. On interruption, discard/retry the incomplete local transaction; never advance the cursor or perform absence deletion early.

The state/page RPCs and backing tables are service-role-only. The page RPC uses keyset ordering by `canonical_job_id` and caps requests at `1000` rows.

## Usage

After the initial setup and the "Parse Resume Manually" action has successfully run, the system will operate automatically through the scheduled GitHub Actions.

You can interact with the data directly through your Supabase dashboard to view scraped jobs, your parsed resume, and job scores.

### Web Interface for Viewing Data

A Next.js web application is available to view and manage the scraped jobs, your resume details, job scores, and job market insights from the database.

- **Repository:** [jobs-scrapper-web](https://github.com/anandanair/jobs-scraper-web)
- **Setup:** To use the web interface, clone the `jobs-scrapper-web` repository and follow the setup instructions provided in its `README.md` file to run it locally. This will typically involve configuring it to connect to your Supabase instance.
- **Insights UI:** The companion `zeroluck/job-scraper-web` application displays records from `keyword_insights` on its Insights page. The `job_keyword_insights` table provides idempotent per-job source facts behind those aggregates. The UI category tabs are a client-side refinement only; they do not replace server-side archetype scoping in the underlying Supabase query or RPC.

The individual Python scripts can still be run locally for development or testing, but this requires setting up a local Python environment, installing dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and creating a local `.env` file with the necessary credentials (mirroring the GitHub secrets).

### Freehire compatibility contract

Apply `supabase_setup/add_freehire_compat.sql` before enabling incremental classification. `public.freehire_jobs` is the service-role-only publication contract. It keeps canonical `job_id` as downstream identity, exposes `COALESCE(latest_job_id, job_id)` as `live_listing_id`, preserves source timestamps and metadata sidecars, and excludes candidate workflow/resume fields. Only LinkedIn rows with `freehire_compat_status='current'` and a pinned category are published; pending, processing, and failed rows are excluded. The current-status view is a persisted hash/version contract: consumers must not republish independently from raw `public.jobs`, and should compare `freehire_compat_import_hash` during complete keyset sweeps.

`is_remote` is true only for standalone visible-text `remote`; it is never inferred. `freehire_compat_input_hash` binds classification to canonical normalized title, visible description, location, LinkedIn level, canonical `job_id`, and schema/taxonomy version. `freehire_compat_import_hash` tracks every published source/projection, classification, deterministic remote, live-ID, and effective timestamp field. Claims and writes compare the expected database source snapshot, and workers reread the claimed row before classification. `backfill_freehire_compat.py` performs a complete bounded keyset sweep and defaults to dry-run; use `--apply` only after reviewing counts.

The downstream private Freehire derive/restore implementation remains a dependency outside this repository. Run source classification and preservation before derive, then order restoration as `derive -> linkedin-restore -> workbc-restore -> reindex -> supabase_out`. Restore only hash-matched source facets; keep `external_id=job_id` and use `latest_job_id` only for the live URL. This repository does not modify stock Freehire. The unrelated WorkBC `closed_reason='missing'` constraint failure and `supabase_out` datetime JSON serialization failure are explicitly out of scope.

**Local Development Setup (Optional):**

1.  **Clone your forked repository locally:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anandanair/linkedin-jobs-scrapper
    cd linkedin-jobs-scrapper
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # On Windows
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    playwright install # Install browser drivers for Playwright
    ```
4.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    - In the root of your local repository, create a `.env` file.
    - Add the keys and values that you configured as GitHub secrets:

      ```env
      # Essential Keys
      LLM_API_KEY="YOUR_LLM_API_KEY"
      SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
      SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"

      # Note: LLM settings (MODEL, RPM, etc.) can be configured in config.py
      ```

5.  **Run scripts locally (example):**
    ```bash
    python scraper.py
    python resume_parser.py
    python score_jobs.py
    python job_manager.py
    ```

### Safe backfill order for archetype-aware filtering and insights

1. Apply `supabase_setup/init.sql` and `supabase_setup/add_job_insights.sql`.
2. Run `python backfill_filter.py` to stamp legacy LinkedIn rows with `software_tpm`, clear the removed aerospace-defense filter, and reapply archetype-aware filters.
3. Run `JOB_INSIGHTS_REPLACEMENT_BACKFILL=true JOB_INSIGHTS_ARCHETYPE=software_tpm python analyze_jobs.py` to rebuild facts and aggregates from the clean corpus.

### End-to-end rebuild verification for clean insights

1. Start from a clean archetype-scoped corpus by completing the safe backfill order above.
2. Run `JOB_INSIGHTS_REPLACEMENT_BACKFILL=true JOB_INSIGHTS_ARCHETYPE=software_tpm python analyze_jobs.py` so `job_keyword_insights` is fully replaced for the scoped corpus before `keyword_insights` is rebuilt.
3. Verify the rebuilt `keyword_insights` rows remain separated by `archetype`, `keyword`, and `category` rather than collapsing shared keywords across archetypes.
4. Confirm the rebuilt aggregate contains the expected `software_tpm` / `Python` / `technology` row with count `2` when the source facts include two matching software TPM rows.
5. Verify the server query or RPC used by the web app is explicitly archetype-scoped before any UI tab filtering is applied.
6. In the web app, verify the Insights page category tabs filter only within the already-scoped `software_tpm` dataset returned from Supabase, so switching tabs never reintroduces rows from a different archetype.

### Listing identity and repost semantics

- `seen_count` is the number of distinct source listing IDs retained in `listing_instances`. A source ID is an observation or variant, not proof of a repost.
- A posting wave groups source IDs at the same known normalized location when they share an effective `posted_at` date or a `scrape_run_id`. If both are unavailable, observations on the same UTC scrape date are grouped conservatively. Instances with unknown location remain variants but never confirm chronological reposts.
- `posting_wave_count` is the maximum wave count for any one normalized location. `repost_count` is `max(posting_wave_count - 1, 0)`.
- Recruiter-only changes and multiple source IDs in one wave are `simultaneous_variant` instances and do not increment `repost_count`.
- Exact normalized locations are required for automatic canonical matching. Cross-location records are not silently merged. Historical grouped data can retain `location_variant` instances, which remain outside `repost_count`.
- Every new instance stores `location`, `normalized_location`, `posting_wave_key`, `posting_wave_index`, and `variant_type`. Missing historical locations remain null unless recovered from an archived source snapshot.
- Guest search cards are recorded before known-ID filtering in append-only `listing_observations`, scoped to an `ingestion_runs` row. Replaying one run is idempotent, while failed or partial coverage remains explicit and cannot prove that a listing disappeared.
- A known ID becomes a relist detail candidate only after its stable card date moves forward by at least two calendar days. At least two observations must establish the prior date. One-day moves, backward dates, and late/out-of-order dates remain auditable corrections and never create relist events.
- Detail work reserves bounded capacity for accepted-but-unprojected same-ID relists before new IDs, then handles stale metadata. Pending relists remain durable in `listing_states.pending_relist_on` and are retried after failed or deferred detail fetches. `LINKEDIN_RELIST_REFRESH_LIMIT_PER_QUERY` and `LINKEDIN_RELIST_REFRESH_LIMIT_PER_RUN` cap relist detail requests; the existing guest detail retry and User-Agent path is reused.
- Exact description hashes are stored in `listing_content_versions`. New hashes retain one full version and update the canonical description/fingerprint; unchanged hashes update version timestamps and observation count only. Description edits alone are content edits, not relists.
- Accepted `listing_relist_events` are deterministic lower-bound evidence. `same_id_relist_count` means "relisted at least once" rather than an exact historical count. Same-ID evidence joins the location/date posting-wave fold without increasing distinct-ID `seen_count` or double-counting a simultaneous new-ID variant.
- `ENABLE_LINKEDIN_RELIST_TRACKING=false` is the observation kill switch; `ENABLE_LINKEDIN_RELIST_EFFECTS=false` keeps shadow collection while suppressing same-ID relist effects.

Apply `supabase_setup/add_posting_wave_semantics.sql` before deploying code that writes `posting_wave_count`. Then inspect the idempotent repair dry run:

```bash
python repair_repost_history.py
```

Only after reviewing its counts, apply it explicitly:

```bash
python repair_repost_history.py --apply
```

The repair reads archived source snapshots when available, preserves every distinct source ID, fills only recoverable locations, and recalculates wave annotations and counts. Do not run the migration or `--apply` command against production without explicit authorization.

Apply `supabase_setup/add_same_id_relist_tracking.sql` before enabling observation writes. Review the same-ID repair in dry-run mode:

```bash
python backfill_same_id_relists.py --limit 500
```

Only reviewed output should be applied with `--apply`. The repair uses stored observations and listing instances only, is idempotent, and cannot invent intermediate relists, employer intent, or missing evidence. Scope is prospective guest-card detection plus an honest lower-bound backfill; authenticated LinkedIn scraping is explicitly excluded.

After the archive repair, unresolved LinkedIn source IDs can be sampled with a conservative dry run:

```bash
python backfill_historical_linkedin_locations.py --limit 50
```

Apply only reviewed recoveries with:

```bash
python backfill_historical_linkedin_locations.py --limit 50 --apply
```

The rescrape command fetches exact source IDs, writes only previously missing locations, records `location_source=linkedin_rescrape` and observation time, and recalculates waves. A failed or unavailable historical page leaves the location null. It does not infer historical `posted_at`, replace existing locations, or create listing IDs.

Stored instance salary text can be normalized without network requests:

```bash
python backfill_listing_instance_salary.py
python backfill_listing_instance_salary.py --apply
```

This fills only missing `salary_min`, `salary_max`, and `salary_currency`, preserves existing structured values, and records `salary_metadata_source=salary_text_parser`.

### Scrape recovery window

- Scheduled LinkedIn runs use a 48-hour lookback, providing overlap beyond the daily schedule.
- `public.scrape_run_state` stores the required successful-completion watermark. GitHub Actions supplies the last successful workflow timestamp as a recovery fallback. Failed or partial runs do not advance the database watermark.
- The next run expands its lookback to elapsed time since that watermark plus six hours, capped at seven days.
- Source listing-ID deduplication and posting-wave calculation make overlapping searches idempotent.
- A last-seen listing ID is not used as a cursor because LinkedIn search ordering is not a durable total order and one ID cannot represent all configured queries.

For one-off recovery, run the scraper workflow with `lookback_hours=96` or `168`. The workflow input raises the database-configured lookback for that run; normal scheduled runs return to the 48-hour database baseline automatically. Keep `archetype` blank for a complete recovery that may advance the global scrape watermark and publication pipeline. Recovery runs are bounded by the workflow's three-hour scrape timeout and retain the same source-wide request cadence.

### Freehire publication snapshots

The hourly source workflow finalizes an immutable, pull-only snapshot after all source jobs succeed. It does not contact or dispatch to a downstream system. `service_role` remains a source-side writer and is the only role allowed to execute `finalize_freehire_publication`; never distribute a `service_role` key downstream.

The migration creates the dedicated `freehire_publication_reader` database role as `NOLOGIN`. Supabase API JWT issuance and role mapping are external to this repository. Operators must create a narrowly scoped JWT/database API role and map or grant it to `freehire_publication_reader`. That identity receives only `EXECUTE` on `get_freehire_publication_state()` and `get_freehire_publication_page(...)`; it receives no table privileges and cannot finalize. `anon` and `authenticated` remain denied.

Consumers should:

1. Read the current complete generation with `get_freehire_publication_state()`.
2. Page that generation with `get_freehire_publication_page(...)`, using the last `canonical_job_id` as the keyset cursor and at most 1000 rows per request.
3. Finish one generation promptly. Exactly the latest three complete generations are retained. Each page RPC transaction is safe against concurrent pruning, but a consumer spanning multiple page requests can fall behind retention. If the page RPC reports that a generation is unavailable, discard the partial import and restart from current state.

Finalization serializes publishers and takes a bounded `SHARE` lock on `jobs`, so source validation and copying use one unchanged relational view in a single transaction. Empty generations are rejected. The RPC validates authoritative watermark direction, same-watermark integrity, schema/count metadata, and copied count before advancing state, then prunes only completed generations.
